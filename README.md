# InfoCage

Continuous governance for security in dynamic systems.

InfoCage is an early-stage framework exploring how security and governance must evolve from static, periodic controls into continuous, real-time governance.

The project currently defines two related but distinct models:

- **Sphere** – an evolution beyond the CIA triad, extending security into dynamic, multi-dimensional interaction.
- **CAGE (Continuous Active Governance Engine)** – a governance framework designed to operate continuously across organizational, technical, and risk layers.

This repository currently focuses on conceptual definition and structure. No implementation is provided at this stage.
